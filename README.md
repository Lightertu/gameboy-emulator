# Gameboy Emulator

A gameboy emulator implemented in C/C++ using SDL2 (Only works on Linux so far)

HOW TO USE: 
  - Install SDL2 and make sure it is in your path
  - change the ROM file name in main.cpp. NOTE: it has to be a .txt file
  - make
  - ./main


# TODO list
  - Implementing bank switching
  - Create a GUI for loading ROM file
  - Optimizing the speed
